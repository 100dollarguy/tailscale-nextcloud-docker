# Self-Hosted Nextcloud with Docker, Caddy, and Tailscale

This project lets me run my own private Nextcloud server on my Mac using Docker Compose, with secure remote access through Tailscale‚Äôs MagicDNS and HTTPS provided by Caddy as a reverse proxy. It‚Äôs private, secure, and accessible only within my Tailscale network.

---

## üîß Why I Built This

I wanted a personal cloud service‚Äîlike Google Drive but hosted by me‚Äîso I could keep my files private without relying on third-party servers. It was also a way to learn Docker networking, VPNs with Tailscale, and secure web access with Caddy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Nextcloud** for cloud storage and syncing  
- **Docker Compose** to manage containers  
- **MariaDB** as the Nextcloud database  
- **Redis** to improve performance  
- **Caddy** for automatic HTTPS and reverse proxy  
- **Tailscale** for a private VPN and MagicDNS  
- **Colima** to run Docker on macOS with Linux networking

## üöß Challenges

- Needed Colima because Docker can‚Äôt easily access the macOS network  
- Caddy reverse proxy required correct port and hostname setup  
- MagicDNS short names didn‚Äôt resolve until fixing macOS DNS  
- Learned that SSL setup is still useful even when using Tailscale VPN  

---

## üìö What I Learned

- Managing Docker containers with shared volumes and networks  
- Using Colima for Linux-style Docker on macOS  
- Securing local services with Caddy reverse proxy and HTTPS  
- How Tailscale MagicDNS simplifies device-to-device access  
- Troubleshooting DNS and networking on different platforms  

---

## ‚úÖ Future Plans

- Add backups for Nextcloud data  
- Configure email for password recovery  
- Install useful Nextcloud plugins  
- Enable two-factor authentication for admins

## üèÅ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/100dollarguy/tailscale-nextcloud-docker.git
    cd tailscale-nextcloud-docker
```    

2. Start Colima and the Docker stack:

```shell
    colima start
    docker compose up -d
```

3. Access Nextcloud in your browser via Tailscale domain:

```shell
    http://rohans-macbook-air.wolf-humboldt.ts.net   (Your Tailscale IP or Magic DNS)
```

## üîí Important

This setup is intended for private use within a Tailscale VPN. Do **not** expose it publicly without adding extra security measures.
